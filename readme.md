### Current Game:


![](readme-assets/mobilescreenshot-jeopardy.png)

This game started as one of my first ever web projects and was my first application of HTML, CSS, Javsacript and JQuery. This was my beginning. 

In 2024 I have started to revisit this project for some fun and upgraded the libraries used and refactored to make them work.

#### Future development:

* Performance optimize the game by running Lighthouse Audits
* Make the game competitive/two player
* Add a high-score table, or way of saving/sharing a score result

#### Technologies used in this game include:

 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * ~~Bootstrap 3.3.7~~
    * Bootstrap Upgraded to 5.0.2
 * ~~JQuery 3.1~~
    * jQuery Upgraded to 3.6.3

Resources referred to include:

* [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
* [Bootstrap JS Modals documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals)
* [jQuery API documentation](https://api.jquery.com/)
